## REQUIREMENTS

You need a VIM version that was compiled with python support, which is typical
for most distributions on Linux/Mac.  You can check this by running
``vim --version | grep +python``
if you get a hit you are in business.

You will need to npm install `js2coffee` and `coffee-script` to preform the actual compilation. Make
sure that you have access to both `js2coffee` and `coffee` from your shell in order for this plugin
to be able to function.


## Usage

The plugin provides four commands:

    JSBuffer2Coffee
    JSSelection2Coffee
    CoffeeBuffer2JS
    CoffeeSelection2JS

For ease of usage you can map the above actions to a shortcut. For example,
if you wanted leader mappings you could set something like the following in
your vimrc:

    nnoremap<Leader>bc :CoffeeBuffer2JS<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>sc :CoffeeSelection2JS<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>bj :JSBuffer2Coffee<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>bs :JSSelection2Coffee<CR>
